This repo is a software that my uncle wrote in Perl about 15 to 20 years ago. It is using OpenGL which was last supported by the Maverick's OS, haven't not found a newer one (yet). My objective is to write a GenAI application to documented it, update it, clean it, convert to Python and make the program run again. Please free to contribute! :)
